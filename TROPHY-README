Documentation for using the Trophy features of the webapp.

In order to use the Trophy features to the fullest extent, the following configuration changes need to be made:
1. You should create a local_settings.py file in the same directory as your settings.py file. The only thing that needs to be in the local_settings.py file are the following fields:

EMAIL_HOST='your_value_here'
EMAIL_HOST_USER='your_value_here'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your_value_here'
EMAIL_PORT = your_port_here
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True

Once this is set up it will enable the trophy code to send an appropriate email to the user.

2. Next you will want to make sure you have created a valid core user via the admin app. The core user needs to have a first name, and a valid e-mail address.  If you want to sample load some test data to test the signals in this webapp, the username of one of your test users needs to be 'sampleman'.

3. Lastly before you start testing you need to run 'python manage.py syncdb' from your project directory.  This will load in the sample trophies that have been pre-created for you.  If you desire you can also run 'python manage.py loaddata search_data.json' which will load some test data and call the signal to show you what will occur when trophy conditions are met after our search log has been used. NOTE : in order for the loaddata command to work YOU MUST CREATE A TEST USER with a username of 'sampleman'.

4. Now you are ready to test the webapp.  Start up the web server and log in to the webapp. After you have logged in successfully, try typing /trophyroom/ in the URL after your port number you have used.
 If this works -  you should see 4 trophies with appropriate pictures.
 Assuming that you are logged in with an appropriate user that has a valid e-mail address, you can click the button "EARN THIS TROPHY" next to any appropriate trophy you wish to earn.  This will give you a Javascript alert that you have earned a trophy,  an e-mail to the user's e-mail that you are logged in with, and should add a TrophyCase row to the table on the bottom of the webpage.
